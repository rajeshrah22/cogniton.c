# cogniton.c

**cogniton.c** is an educational project aimed at building a Large Language Model (LLM) entirely in C. Through this project, we strive to explore the core mechanics of neural networks, the implementation of tensors and transformers, and the performance limits of neural networks on CPUs. Along the way, we aim to share our journey with the community to inspire and educate.

## Goals

1. **Develop an LLM in C**: 
   - Understand the fundamental principles of tensors and transformer architectures by implementing them from scratch in the C programming language.

2. **Explore the Limits of Neural Nets on CPUs**:
   - Investigate the computational challenges and boundaries of running neural networks on CPU architectures, offering insights into performance, optimization, and scalability.

3. **Share Our Journey**:
   - Provide transparent documentation, tutorials, and lessons learned to help others understand the process and challenges of creating an LLM in C.

## Why C?
C provides low-level control over memory and computation, making it an excellent choice for deeply understanding the mechanics of machine learning models. By avoiding high-level abstractions, we can:
- Gain deeper insights into how tensors, matrix multiplications, and neural networks function at their core.
- Optimize for performance on CPU-based systems.
- Create an educational resource for those curious about how modern AI models operate under the hood.

## Features
- **Tensor Operations**: Core mathematical operations for building neural network layers.
- **Transformer Architecture**: A minimal yet functional implementation of transformers.
- **CPU Optimization**: Techniques to maximize efficiency and performance on CPUs.
- **Community Engagement**: Regular updates, blog posts, and opportunities for collaboration.
